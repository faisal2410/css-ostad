// Specificity in CSS is a measure of how specific a selector is when targeting elements in an HTML document. The specificity of a selector is used to determine which styles will be applied when multiple selectors target the same element.

// CSS selectors can be categorized into four levels of specificity, which are:

// Element selectors - these have the lowest specificity and target all elements of a given type, such as p, h1, or div.

// Class selectors - these have higher specificity and target elements with a specific class attribute, such as .my-class.

// ID selectors - these have even higher specificity and target elements with a specific ID attribute, such as #my-id.

// Inline styles - these have the highest specificity and are applied directly to an element using the style attribute.

// When multiple selectors target the same element, the selector with the highest specificity will take precedence and its styles will be applied. For example, if a p element has both an inline style and a class style applied to it, the inline style will take precedence because it has a higher specificity.

// It's important to understand specificity in CSS because it can affect how styles are applied to your HTML elements. By being mindful of the specificity of your selectors, you can avoid unintended conflicts and ensure that your styles are applied consistently across your document.
